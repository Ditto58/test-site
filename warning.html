<p>These ROMs have been collected from various ROM sites. <i>These have all come from my PERSONAL collection, just so you know.</i> If you would like to request a ROM or request a <u>MODDED</u> ROM, or if you would like to request a PATCH ROM-meaning I have to patch the ROM file to mod it-please contact me at insertemailhere@gmail.com If it's a normal ROM request, please put the subject as "ROM". If it's a Patch, put "Patch", and if it's a modded ROM, put "Modded ROM" Thanks!</p>
